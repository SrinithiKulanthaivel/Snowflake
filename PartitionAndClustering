Partition - dividing huge dataset/tables into smaller chunks, so that each part can manipulated independently.
  - snowflake by default divide the data in the table into small chunks range from 50 MB to 500MB
  - Metadata of each partitions stored in Cloud Service Layer.
      - Meta data contain range of values in each partition, no of unique value and properties for efficient query processing and data scanning. 

Clustering - process of optimize data retrieval.
  - performed on micro-partition to ensure similar data stored in the same micro partition and retrived using single query
  - Clustering Key - column or group of cloumn that are designed to locate the data in micro-partition.
  - Pruning is process of snowflake avoid scanning the unnecessary micro-partition using clustering Key in the where clause. 

Usually snowflake divide the table data into micro partition by default and we can also partition the data which will be very useful in querying.
And while clustering we need to select the column which are not very frequent 
eg - if we select time - then each row is a different micro partition - Bad approach (High cardinality)
  -  if we select Month - all the record of each month will store in separate partition - Good approach. (Low Cardinality)


use warehouse compute_wh;
use schema snowflake_sample_data.tpch_sf1000;

select system$clustering_information('Lineitem'); // it will show the clustered table information

show tables like '%line%' // snow the table information in table format.

select * from lineitem where l_shipdate='1998-12-01' limit 20000;

// if we give the correct partition id in the where then it will check only in those partition
// if we give random where condition it will check in all the partation.
// That too based on limit. if the limit is less then only in one partation
// if the limit is high then multiple partition. 
// By default snowflake maintain a partition and we can also partition the data. 
// after executing the query we can click on the query Id and check how the data executed.
    -- - how many % came from cache.
    -- - how many % came from disk
    -- - how many partition used for scanning. 
    -- - we can also clear the cache and check the result.
