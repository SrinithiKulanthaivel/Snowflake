Roles :
AccountAdmin : Top-level, granted to limited no.of users.
SecurityAdmin: Monitor and manage users & roles. - Modify, grant or revoke privileges.
UserAdmin    : Create User and roles. - Grant Privileges to other roles.
SysAdmin     : Privileges to create db objects - grant privileges on db objects to other roles.
OrgAdmin     : Manage Operations at organization level
Public       : Automatically assigned to all users and roles. 

Snowflake Architecture: 
      Cloud Service  - Brain of the system, managing infrastructure, access control, security, metadata,....
      Query Processing - Muscle of the system, Perform Massive Parallel Processing (MPP)
      Storage - Hybrid Columnar Storage, Stored as blob. 

Snowflake architectg is hybrid of the following two types. 
    *  "Shared Disk Database" - Shared memory space through network.
            Internet -> CPU1, CPU2  ---network-->   Disk1, Disk2,Disk3 
    *  "Shared Nothing Database". - separate memory space. 
            Internet -> CPU 1 -> Disk1, Disk2,Disk3
                     -> CPU 1 -> Disk1, Disk2,Disk3

Object Hierarchy 

Organisation -> Account -> Users
                        -> Roles
                        -> Warehouses
                        -> Databases
                              -> Schema
                                    -> Tables
                                    -> Views
                                    -> Stage
                                    -> Stored Procedures
                                    -> UDF

WareHouse - is a cluster of computing resource. Combination of CPU, Memory & Temp Storage.
      - Executing sql queries
      - Data Loading & unloading
      - Size from xs to 5xl
      - Two types - Single Cluster & Multi Cluster


User Defined Functions - UDF
      Extend operations that are not available throught system defined functions
      Reusable code written in SQL, java, python & java script
      It is of two types
            Scalar - function return one output row.
            Tabular - also called table function return zero, one, or multiple row.

External Functions: 
      an external function calls  code that is executed outside snowflake.
      The remotely executed code is known as a remot3e service
      Information sent to a remote service is usually relayed through a proxy service
      External functions are the functions that is stored and executed outside snowflake.

Sample program steps: 

step1 : Create a lambda function in AWS and deploy it. 
step2 : Note the function name and account detail.
step3 : Create an IAM role to access lambda and note rolename and role arn.
step4 : Create an API gateway using rest API, in which we will create a method-> Post/Get/Delete/Update and give the lambda function name(already create lambda) and deploy it.and copy the api arn.
step5 :
