Snowflake Architecture: 
      Cloud Service  - Brain of the system, managing infrastructure, access control, security, metadata,....
      Query Processing - Muscle of the system, Perform Massive Parallel Processing (MPP)
      Storage - Hybrid Columnar Storage, Stored as blob. 

Snowflake architectg is hybrid of the following two types. 
    *  "Shared Disk Database" - Shared memory space through network.
            Internet -> CPU1, CPU2  ---network-->   Disk1, Disk2,Disk3 
    *  "Shared Nothing Database". - separate memory space. 
            Internet -> CPU 1 -> Disk1, Disk2,Disk3
                     -> CPU 1 -> Disk1, Disk2,Disk3

Object Hierarchy 

Organisation -> Account -> Users
                        -> Roles
                        -> Warehouses
                        -> Databases
                              -> Schema
                                    -> Tables
                                    -> Views
                                    -> Stage
                                    -> Stored Procedures
                                    -> UDF

WareHouse - is a cluster of computing resource. Combination of CPU, Memory & Temp Storage.
      - Executing sql queries
      - Data Loading & unloading
      - Size from xs to 5xl
      - Two types - Single Cluster & Multi Cluster
